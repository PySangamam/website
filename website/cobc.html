            <br/>
            <p>PySangamam is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
              for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and
              expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We
              do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.</p>
            <p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including
              people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not
              appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.</p>
            <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
              professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary
              jokes are not appropriate for PySangamam.</p>
            <p>Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a
              refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.</p>
            <p>Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.</p>

            <h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
            <p>Everyone at the PySangamam conference are expected to follow a code of conduct.
              This document shall serve as the reference point for the code, and also as a
              place for discussion on any rules that need to be added/changed removed.</p>
            <p>We are here as a community to deliberate on the topics of the forum. Be nice to
              everyone.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Be empathetic</li>
              <li>Be questioning, as it furthers the discussion</li>
              <li>Discuss ideas, not people and their personalities (as that would be ad-hominem)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Broadly, the following have <strong>no</strong> space in the community: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Harassment</li>
              <li>Sexism</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Anyone</strong> found in violation of the code of business conduct will be asked to
              leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference
              organizers.</p>
            <h3 id="who-does-it-apply-to-">Who does it apply to?</h3>
            <p>The code of conduct is applicable equally to all members who are part of the
              conference. This includes: </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Organizers</li>
              <li>Volunteers</li>
              <li>Speakers</li>
              <li>Sponsors</li>
              <li>Reviewers</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is important to emphasize that everyone is expected to follow the rules, and
              can be penalised as appropriate in case of violations.</p>
            <h3 id="details">Details</h3>
            <h4 id="harrassment">Harrassment</h4>
            <p>We strongly condemn any kind of harassment of any fellow participant, speaker
              or representative from sponsorsâ€™ organization.</p>
            <p>Members are expected to stay civil in their discussions online as well as
              offline. Especially towards newer members who may be asking very basic
              questions or are not aware of the conventions of online conversations. Members
              are also expected to warn and then report any violations.</p>
            <p>Any actions falling under the banner of harassment will invite a warning or an
              immediate ban depending on the seriousness.</p>
            <h4 id="sexism">Sexism</h4>
            <p>Members of the group shall try to make participants comfortable by not
              indulging into sexist behavior. They will not use nude/pornographic content
              while interacting with the group. They will also not use sexist references in
              way of humour. </p>
            <p>Being sexist includes offensive remarks or jokes made about women, men, persons
              of non-binary genders and those with physical disabilities, or on the basis of
              sexuality, race, caste or religion.</p>
            <p>Use of images that objectify the human body are heavily discouraged unless
              absolutely relevant to the discussion. Inappropriate physical contact and
              invasion of private space. Deliberate intimidation, unwelcome gestures and
              stalking is NOT OK.</p>
            <p>Any activities as highlighted above or anything that falls into the same bag
              will not be encouraged and such actions will invite a warning and a subsequent
              ban from the group.</p>
            <h4 id="piracy-or-spam">Piracy or Spam</h4>
            <p>Members shall not share any pirated content in online or offline discussions.
              This includes pirated copies of books, educational videos, software and
              torrent link to them. Any such content will be removed by moderators without
              warning.</p>
            <br/>
            <h3 id="reporting-violations">Reporting Violations</h3>
            <p>Please report in confidence by sending an SMS to +91 9940694149. SMSes are
              received by PySangamam Organizers who can address this quickly. Violators,
              regardless of their standing, may be expelled from the forum, without a refund
              (where payment was applicable), and reported to the authorities.</p>

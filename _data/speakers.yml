  description: "Kiran Jonnalagadda has been shipping production software with Python since
1999, but is still confused by basic concepts like closures. He has
successfully masked this confusion by delegating work to others and ranting
about human rights, thereby producing two organisations, HasGeek and the
Internet Freedom Foundation."

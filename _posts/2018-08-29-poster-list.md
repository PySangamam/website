##### **5. Python Real Time Web**

You may know about WSGI. It's very standard specification for web
servers. It's nothing but Request and Response. Traditionally all web
frameworks like Django, Flask, Bottle, web2py follow the WSGI protocol
but the drawback of this WSGI is it's not good for the real-time
web. So what is the alternative to WSGI?

Here comes ASGI. Wait What is ASGI? What can we do with ASGI? Is it
easy to implement? Is it secure in every way? These and more are
answered in this poster presentation.

##### **6. Developing Technology for People with Special Needs using Python**

The poster presentation aims to enlighten how Python has been used to
develop technological devices in enriching the lives of people with
special needs. Tactograph and vPlay are two such devices which has
been built based on this platform.

Tactograph is a tactile printer which uses Python to communicate with
the micro-controller to control linear stage. The tactile images helps
the visually impaired to learn in early stages of education.

vPlay is a wireless touchpad system which can be used to play games in
Python. We have developed a simple ping-pong game which can be played
in Python by taking inputs from the hardware unit. People with motor
disability can easily adopt this since they are made specifically to
meet their requirements.

Python has been used in these products to enable people with
disability to adapt to newer technologies. Itâ€™s helping people with
special needs to lead a better life in terms of education, leisure and
so on.

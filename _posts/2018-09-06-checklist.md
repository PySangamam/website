## Reaching the Venue

The venue, IITM IC&SR is right next to the "Gajendra Circle (GC for
short)", an important landmark within IITM. The distance from IITM
front gate to GC is pretty huge. If you are booking a cab / auto you
might want to drop off at GC, rather than at the IITM front
gate. There are IITM buses at regular intervals from the front gate to
GC.

If you are not familiar with IITM, then entering the campus from the
front gate is the easiest way to locate the venue. You can call us at
the following phone nos., in case you get stuck.

Please be noted that, sufficient car and bike parking is available at
the venue (near IC&SR).

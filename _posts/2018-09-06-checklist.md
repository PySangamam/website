## Reaching the Venue

The venue, IITM IC&SR is right next to the "Gajendra Circle (GC for
short)", an important landmark within IITM. The distance from IITM
front gate to GC is pretty huge. If you are booking a cab / auto you
might want to drop off at GC, rather than at the IITM front
gate. There are IITM buses at regular intervals from the front gate to
GC.

If you are not familiar with IITM, then entering the campus from the
front gate is the easiest way to locate the venue. We will be
providing you with a few phone nos. that you can call up, in case you
get stuck.

Sufficient car and bike parking is available at the venue (near
IC&SR).

We spent quite a while on the logo for PySangamam owing to the fact that it
reflects the image of the whole conference.

The idea was to bring 2 things that were quintessentially Tamil Nadu.

The green part has patterns from Tamil Nadu's beautiful Kanjeevram sarees - a
true heritage of this state donned on many wonderful sarees worn by wonderful
women around the world.

The red part has a Kural. Kurals are couplets that outline how one must live
their everyday lives. This one in particular is #394:

> உவப்பத் தலைக்கூடி உள்ளப் பிரிதல்  
> அனைத்தே புலவர் தொழில்

Which fits a conference setting so perfectly. It says:

> You meet with joy, with pleasant thought you part;  
> Such is the learned scholar's wonderous art!.

Quite a bit of thought went into this logo and we wanted it to reflect Tamil
Nadu's traditions and not just the ones of Madras. We hope we were able to do
that.

				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>
					1. We hope to promote the use of the Python programming language.<br>
						2. We hope to bring together Python developers in this region, to share ideas and learn from each other.<br>
						3. We hope to bring talented local developers to the fore-front, by providing, a platform to present their ideas, and showcase their projects.
</br>
						4. We hope to bridge the gap between budding developers, and Python experts, by bringing them together, and providing spaces for interaction.

			<li>
				<a class="cd-faq-trigger" href="#0">Why the name PySangamam?
</a>
				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>We chose the word "Sangamam", because it captures the spirit of the conference, and hints on the regional nature of it. We were careful not to step-over the names of other Python conferences, regional or otherwise. Hope you like it!

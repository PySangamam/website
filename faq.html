      <p>
        The word Sangamam /ˈsʌnɡʌmʌm/ means <i>confluence</i> in Tamil. Building on
        this, PySangamam is a conference, catering to the Python community
        of Tamil Nadu, a state in southern India.

      <h2 class="text-center"><b>Why the name PySangamam?</b></h2>
      <p>
        We chose the word "Sangamam", because it captures the spirit of the
        conference, and hints on the regional nature of it. We were
        careful not to step-over the names of other Python conferences,
        regional or otherwise. Hope you like it!

      <p>
        People who use Python, and who would like to meet and learn from
        other Python developers. You need to have a basic working knowledge
        of Python, to make the best use of this conference.

        BTW, Python is used by people from diverse backgrounds, and we hope
        to accomodate every one of them, including but not limited to
        scientists, mathematicians, web developers, embedded software
        developers, educators, desktop software developers, game programmers

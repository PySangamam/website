        <p>PySangamam is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
          for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, gender identity and
          expression, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We
          do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.</p>
        <p>All communication should be appropriate for a professional audience including
          people of many different backgrounds. Sexual language and imagery is not
          appropriate for any conference venue, including talks.</p>
        <p>Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other attendees. Behave
          professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary
          jokes are not appropriate for PySangamam.</p>
        <p>Attendees violating these rules may be asked to leave the conference without a
          refund at the sole discretion of the conference organizers.</p>

        <h3 id="overview"><strong>Overview</strong></h3>
        <p>Everyone at the PySangamam conference are expected to follow a code of conduct.
          This document shall serve as the reference point for the code, and also as a
          place for discussion on any rules that need to be added/changed removed.</p>
        <p>We are here as a community to deliberate on the topics of the forum. Be nice to
          everyone.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Be empathetic</li>
          <li>Be questioning, as it furthers the discussion</li>
          <li>Discuss ideas, not people and their personalities (as that would be ad-hominem)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Broadly, the following have <strong>no</strong> space in the community: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Harassment</li>
          <li>Sexism</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Anyone</strong> found in violation of the code of business conduct will be asked to
          leave the conference without a refund at the sole discretion of the conference
          organizers.</p>
        <h3 id="who-does-it-apply-to-"><strong>Who does it apply to?</strong></h3>
        <p>The code of conduct is applicable equally to all members who are part of the
          conference. This includes: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Organizers</li>
          <li>Volunteers</li>
          <li>Speakers</li>
          <li>Sponsors</li>
          <li>Reviewers</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It is important to emphasize that everyone is expected to follow the rules, and
          can be penalised as appropriate in case of violations.</p>
        <h3 id="details"><strong>Details</strong></h3>
        <h4 id="harassment"><strong>Harassment</strong></h4>
        <p>We strongly condemn any kind of harassment of any fellow participant, speaker
          or representative from sponsorsâ€™ organization.</p>
        <p>Members are expected to stay civil in their discussions online as well as
          offline. Especially towards newer members who may be asking very basic
          questions or are not aware of the conventions of online conversations. Members
          are also expected to warn and then report any violations.</p>
        <p>Any actions falling under the banner of harassment will invite a warning or an
          immediate ban depending on the seriousness.</p>
        <h4 id="sexism"><strong>Sexism</strong></h4>
        <p>Members of the group shall try to make participants comfortable by not
          indulging into sexist behavior. They will not use nude/pornographic content
          while interacting with the group. They will also not use sexist references in
          way of humour. </p>
        <p>Being sexist includes offensive remarks or jokes made about women, men, persons
          of non-binary genders and those with physical disabilities, or on the basis of
          sexuality, race, caste or religion.</p>
        <p>Use of images that objectify the human body are heavily discouraged unless
          absolutely relevant to the discussion. Inappropriate physical contact and
          invasion of private space. Deliberate intimidation, unwelcome gestures and
          stalking is NOT OK.</p>
        <p>Any activities as highlighted above or anything that falls into the same bag
          will not be encouraged and such actions will invite a warning and a subsequent
          ban from the group.</p>
        <h4 id="piracy-or-spam"><strong>Piracy or Spam</strong></h4>
        <p>Members shall not share any pirated content in online or offline discussions.
          This includes pirated copies of books, educational videos, software and
          torrent link to them. Any such content will be removed by moderators without
          warning.</p>
        <br/>
        <h3 id="reporting-violations"><strong>Reporting Violations</strong></h3>
        <p>Please report in confidence by sending an SMS to +91 9940694149. SMSes are
          received by PySangamam Organizers who can address this quickly. Violators,
          regardless of their standing, may be expelled from the forum, without a refund
          (where payment was applicable), and reported to the authorities.</p>

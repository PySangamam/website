          The PySangamam Organising Team is grateful to everyone involved in organising this conference.
          We are grateful to all the volunteers who pitched in with their efforts, contributors who made
          the event more affordable to students by purchasing tickets from the Contributor category,
          the local Python community for showing an amazing response and purchasing tickets and to everyone
          who responded to our CFP and submitted outstanding talk proposals.
